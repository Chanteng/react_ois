                  Hello there, My name is <b><i>ODURO ISAAC SAPEY</i></b>, and I am from
                  Apam, Ghana. I kicked off as a graphic designer by working
                  in a printing press after high school, before going to
                  University. As I spent some time around, I began designing
                  flyers, brochures, banners and got interested in creating.
                  Today, I am open to all kinds of design work, although I am
                  always drawn to passion projects that let me go back to my
                  printing press roots. <br /> <p></p><br/>Outside of my design works, I love to 
                  <i> read</i>, and for some time now, I’ve been practicing my writing
                  (I hope it shows in this little piece). I also enjoy <b>playing
                  games</b>, though projects and school don’t give me time to do it
                  regularly. <br /> <p></p><br/>I love to work with startups, though I enjoy
                  working with well established brands as well. Putting
                  together, I have worked on over <b><i>500 projects for people from
                  over 7 countries across the globe</i></b>.<br /> <p></p><br/> Suppose you like my work
                  and are ready to join the hundreds of people who have enjoyed
                  my beautiful designs; please reach out by texting or emailing
                  me. I have the right tools and expertise to touch your brand.<br/>
                  <b>See you on the “Contact page.”</b>
